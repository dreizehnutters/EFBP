  <p>N people decide independently each week whether to go to a bar that offers entertainment on a certain night. For correctness, let us set N at 100. Space is limited, and the evening is enjoyable if things are not too crowded - especially, if fewer than 60 percent of the possible 100 are present. There is no sure way to tell the numbers coming in advance; therefore a person or an agent goes (deems it worth going) if he expects fewer than 60 to show up or stays home if he expects more than 60 to go.</p>
